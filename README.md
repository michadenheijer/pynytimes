```python
top_stories = nyt.top_stories()

# Get all the top stories from a specific category
top_science_stories = nyt.top_stories(section = "science")
```

### Most viewed articles

The New York Times API can provide the most popular articles from the last day, week or month.

```python
most_viewed = nyt.most_viewed()

# Get most viewed articles of last 7 or 30 days
most_viewed = nyt.most_viewed(days = 7)
most_viewed = nyt.most_viewed(days = 30)
```

### Most shared articles

Not only can you request the most viewed articles from the New York Times API, you can also request the most shared articles. You can even request the articles that are most shared by email and Facebook. You can get the most shared articles per day, week or month.

```python
most_shared = nyt.most_shared()

# Get most emaild articles of the last day
most_shared = myt.most_shared(
    days = 1,
    method = "email"
)

# Get most shared articles to Facebook of the last 7 days
most_shared = nyt.most_shared(
    days = 7,
    method = "facebook"    
)

# Get most shared articles to Facebook of the last 30 days
most_shared = nyt.most_shared(
    days = 30,
    method = "facebook"
)
```

### Article search (beta)

You can also search all New York Times articles. You can also define which sources you want to include. (Not all functions are implemented)

```python
import datetime

articles = nyt.article_search(
    query = "Obama",
    results = 30,
    dates = {
        "begin": datetime.datetime(2019, 1, 31),
        "end": datetime.datetime(2019, 2, 28)
    }
    options = {
        sources = [
            "New York Times",
            "AP",
            "Reuters",
            "International Herald Tribune"
        ]
    }
)
```

### Book reviews

You can easily find book reviews for every book you've read. You can find those reviews by searching for the author, ISBN or title of the book.

```python
# Get reviews by author (first and last name)
reviews = nyt.book_reviews(author = "George Orwell")

# Get reviews by ISBN
reviews = nyt.book_reviews(isbn = 9780062963673)

# Get book reviews by title
reviews = nyt.book_reviews(title = "Becoming")
```

### Movie reviews

You can not only get the book reviews, but the movie reviews too.

```python
import datetime

reviews = nyt.movie_reviews(
    keyword = "Green Book",
    options = {
        "order": "by-opening-date",
        "reviewer": "A.O. Scott",
        "critics_pick": False
    },
    dates = {
        "opening_date_start": datetime.datetime(2017, 1, 1),
        "opening_date_end": datetime.datetime(2019, 1, 1),
        "publication_date_start": datetime.datetime(2017, 1, 1),
        "publication_date_end": datetime.datetime(2019, 1, 1)
})
```

### Best sellers lists

The New York Times has multiple best sellers lists. You can easily request those lists using this library.

```python
# Get all the available New York Times best sellers lists
lists = nyt.best_sellers_lists()

# Get fiction best sellers list
books = nyt.best_sellers_list()

# Get non-fiction best sellers list
books = nyt.best_sellers_list(
    name = "combined-print-and-e-book-nonfiction"
)

# Get best sellers lists from other date
import datetime

books = nyt.best_sellers_list(
    name = "combined-print-and-e-book-nonfiction",
    date = datetime.datetime(2019, 1, 1)
)
```

### Article metadata

With an URL from a New York Times article you can easily get all the metadata you need from it.

```python
metadata = nyt.article_metadata(
    url = "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/20/world/middleeast/erdogan-turkey-nuclear-weapons-trump.html"
)
```

### Tag query

The New York Times has their own tags library. You can query this library with this API.

```python
tags = nyt.tag_query(
    "pentagon",
    max_results = 20
)
```

### Archive metadata

If you want to load all the metadata from a specific month, then this API makes that possible. Be aware you'll download a big JSON file (about 20 Mb), so it can take a while.

```python
import datetime

data = nyt.archive_metadata(
    date = datetime.datetime(2019, 1, 1)
)
```
