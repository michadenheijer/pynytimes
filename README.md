# Introduction to pynytimes

The New York Times is one of the most trusted news source around the world. All their article metadata is easily available using their API, which is publicly available to everyone (though only for non-commercial use). All this data can be queried using a REST API, however setting it up can be quite time-consuming. This library solves that problem, now you can easily and quickly query the API without having to worry about the specific implementation.
